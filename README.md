Reading-CSV-file-from-SD-Card (TIME value)

The goal of the following code is to search for a specific time value (introduced by the user) in a CSV file logged by different sensors. 
The CSV file includes reading values such as pressure, temperature, altitude, depth, time, and location among others. The data come from 
attached sensors to a sonde (electronic board). 

The code checks in the CSV file if the time exists (no matter the order of the time column in the CSV file is) and if so it prints out the
reading values of all the sensors associated/dated with that time.
